Greetings everyone,

🏏 **Cricket Data Analytics Project: T20 World Cup 2022 Insights** 🏏

I am thrilled to share my latest data analytics endeavor, an in-depth analysis of the T20 World Cup 2022, powered by Python, SQL, and PowerBI.

🔍 **Exploring the 2022 T20 World Cup Dataset**: The project commenced with an exploration of a comprehensive dataset, providing a treasure trove of insights from the T20 World Cup 2022.

🛠 **Tools Used**: Python and Power BI

⚙ **Skills Applied**: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, ETL, Power Query, DAX (Data Analysis Expression) for Measures and Metrics, Data analysis, Data visualization, Report, and Dashboard. Plus, data validation through SQL queries.

🧹 **Meticulous Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Python played a pivotal role in meticulous data cleaning and transformation, ensuring the dataset was primed for detailed analysis.

🔄 **Smooth JSON to CSV Conversion**: Converting JSON files to CSV was a strategic move, facilitating seamless integration with PowerBI, a crucial step in this analytical journey.

📊 **Powerful Insights in PowerBI**: The PowerBI platform provided a robust environment to load, transform, and gain in-depth insights from the datasets.

📈 **Crafting Essential Measures with DAX**: Through DAX, I engineered 25 key measures, unlocking comprehensive insights into player statistics.

📑 **Dashboard Pages for Every Role**: Six dedicated pages were meticulously designed for Openers, Middle Order Batsmen, Finishers, Bowlers, All Rounders, and the Best 11 from all teams.

🎯 **Defining Best 11 Criteria**: The Best 11 players were chosen based on impressive statistics: Batting Average (39), Strike Rate (144), Bowling Average (13), and a remarkable 53 wickets in total.

🚀 **Ready for Prime Time!**: I am thrilled to unveil this project, showcasing my prowess in data analytics with a special focus on cricket statistics.
